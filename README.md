# Bubble Chase
Mr. Fish and the Case of the Holy Shell 

Bubble Chase is an underwater survival game. You are a fish who must evade the attacking bubbles for as long as you can. Move your avatar by moving the mouse around the screen. Every time the bubbles collide with you, your health decreases. Once your health has depleted, the game is over. Your health can be increased by acquiring a holy shell. By clicking the mouse, you can drop a jellyfish to give yourself five seconds of rest before the bubbles focus back on you. Beware though, clicking also brings in five new bubbles...until you can no longer escape...
